# Feed Reader Testing

The feedreader.js tests the feed reader page to ensure that all features work
accordingly.  It tests:

*   That the allFeeds array is defined and is not empty.
*   That the allFeeds array url and name properties are defined and not empty.
*   The menu works properly by being hidden by default and changes visibility when clicked.
*   That a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function.
*   Loading the loadFeed function results in at least a single .entry element.

## How to Run

*   Download or clone from https://github.com/cglisson/FeedReader.
*   Run index.html in your favorite browser.
*   The result of the tests are located at the bottom of the page.
